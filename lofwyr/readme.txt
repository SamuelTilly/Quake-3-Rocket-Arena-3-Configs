it s a little messy but here you go :)
  
- armes.cfg has every weapon binds i use (i change my weaps setting a lot, so this cfg is 95% of what i play with, but i sometime change sens / accel). 
 
- q3config.cfg is the main cfg
 
- stats.cfg and bright.cfg are cfg with ra3 commands to have bright skin and some key binded  for the stats (usefull when nmy models are broken, u only have to re-exec bright.cfg)
 
- cross.cfg is a script to change crosshair color with a bind, usefull for testing purpose.

- rec.cfg is a script to record demos, it s binded on "k", you hit k once it starts recording, twice and it stops.

- and finaly zz2.cfg is the cfg that execute most of the other cfg 


So usually when i launch my game i exec q3config, then zz2, then armes.cfg if needed.
